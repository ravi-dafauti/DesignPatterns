In this method, object is created only if it is needed. This may prevent resource wastage. An implementation of getInstance() method is required which return the instance. There is a null check that if object is not created then create, otherwise return previously created. To make sure that class cannot be instantiated in any other way, constructor is made final. As object is created with in a method, it ensures that object will not be created until and unless it is required. Instance is kept private so that no one can access it directly.
